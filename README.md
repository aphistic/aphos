aphOS
---

I created aphOS as a way to better understand how Operating Systems work and mess with my computers at the lowest levels.  This isn't meant (at the moment, at least) to be something that you can actually use.  It may never be!  Use the code and the OS at your own risk. :)

It's licensed under the MIT license, you can see a copy of it in the docs directory or in the headers of some files.

LLVM Project - This is the resource I used to figure out how to bend cmake to my will.
